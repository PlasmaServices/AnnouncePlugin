## üîç Troubleshooting

### No Announcements Showing

1. **Verify User ID**
   ```bash
   # Check your config.yml has the correct format
   user-id: "usr_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

2. **Test API Manually**
   ```bash
   # Visit in browser or curl:
   https://announce.layeredy.com/api/announce/YOUR_USER_ID
   # Should return JSON with "hasAnnouncement": true/false
   ```

3. **Check Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Ensure players have permission to see announcements
   /lp user <player> permission set layeredyannounce.see true
   ```

4. **Enable Debug Mode**
   ```bash
   /layeredyannounce debug on
   /layeredyannounce check
   # Check console for detailed logs
   ```

### API Connection Issues

1. **Test Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # From server console or in-game
   /layeredyannounce test
   ```

2. **Check Firewall**
   - Ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is allowed
   - Whitelist `announce.layeredy.com` if needed

3. **Verify Configuration**
   ```bash
   /layeredyannounce status
   # Check that the full endpoint URL is correct
   ```

### Boss Bars Not Visible

1. **Check Player Permissions**
   ```bash
   /layeredyannounce test
   # This should show a test boss bar
   ```

2. **Verify Duration Settings**
   ```yaml
   # In config.yml, ensure duration is reasonable
   bossbar:
     duration: 10  # At least 5 seconds
   ```

3. **Test with Different Colors/Styles**
   ```yaml
   bossbar:
     color: "RED"      # More visible
     style: "SOLID"    # Simpler style
   ```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Connection test failed" | Check internet connectivity and firewall |
| "Invalid user ID format" | Ensure ID starts with `usr_` and is 32 chars |
| "No permission" | Grant `layeredyannounce.see` to players |
| "Boss bar disappears immediately" | Increase `bossbar.duration` in config |
| "Announcements repeat" | Check if `showOnce` is false in Layeredy dashboard |
